================Set up nodejs to server====================================
Then use apt-get to install the git package, which npm depends on:
sudo apt-get install git

1) cd to remote directory and download nodejs setup file
cd ~
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.3/node-v4.2.3-linux-x64.tar.gz

2) Extract nodejs file
mkdir node
tar xvf node-v*.tar.?z --strip-components=1 -C ./node

3)Next, we'll configure the global prefix of npm, 
where npm will create symbolic links to installed Node packages, 
to somewhere that it's in your default path. We'll set it to /usr/local with this command:

mkdir node/etc
echo 'prefix=/usr/local' > node/etc/npmrc

4)Now we're ready to move the node and npm binaries to our installation location. We'll move it into /opt/node with this command:
$sudo mv node /opt/

5)At this point, you may want to make root the owner of the files:

$sudo chown -R root: /opt/node

6) Lastly, let's create symbolic links of the node and npm binaries in your default path. We'll put the links in /usr/local/bin with these commands:

sudo ln -s /opt/node/bin/node /usr/local/bin/node
sudo ln -s /opt/node/bin/npm /usr/local/bin/npm

7) Verify that Node is installed by checking its version with this command:
node -v

The Node.js runtime is now installed, and ready to run an application! Let's write a Node.js application.



==========================Open listening port into firewal=====================
1) sudo ufw allow 3000
2) check status of port
sudo ufw status


==========================Setup Ip address and port to node js app====================

var server = app.listen(3000, "0.0.0.0", function () {
    var host = server.address().address
    var port = server.address().port  
    console.log("Trading app listening at http://%s:%s", host, port)  
});


============================Manage Application with PM2==================================
The first thing you will want to do is use the pm2 start command to run your application, main.js, in the background:

> start service command
pm2 start main.js

>stop service command
pm2 stop main

> restart sevice command
pm2 restart main

> The list of applications currently managed by PM2 can also be looked up with the list subcommand:
pm2 list
