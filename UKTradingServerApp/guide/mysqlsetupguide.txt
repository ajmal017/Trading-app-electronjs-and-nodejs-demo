1) sudo apt-get update
2) sudo apt-get install mysql-server
You'll be prompted to create a root password during the installation. Choose a secure one and make sure you remember it, because you'll need it later.

3) mysql_secure_installation

This will prompt you for the root password you created in Step 1. You can press Y and then ENTER to accept the defaults for all the subsequent questions, with the exception of the one that asks if you'd like to change the root password. You just set it in Step 1, so you don't have to change it now. 

4) Testing mysql connection

MySQL should have started running automatically. To test this, check its status.

systemctl status mysql.service

If MySQL isn't running, you can start it with 

sudo systemctl start mysql

For an additional check, you can try connecting to the database using the mysqladmin tool, which is a client that lets you run administrative commands. For example, this command says to connect to MySQL as root (-u root), prompt for a password (-p), and return the version.

mysqladmin -p -u root version
